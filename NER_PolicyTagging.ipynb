Computer Based Training (CBT). A forum for training in which the student learns via a computer terminal. It is an especially effective training tool that allows the students to practice applications while they learn. Continuation Training. Additional advanced training that exceeds the minimum upgrade training requirements and emphasizes present or future duty assignments. Continuum of Learning (CoL). The deliberate process of combining education, training, and experience to produce the right expertise and competence to meet the Air Force‚Äôs operational needs. (AFDD 1-1, Annex 1-1). The end goal is to create a culture of lifelong learning. Core Task. A task AFCFMs identify as a minimum qualification requirement for everyone within an AFSC regardless of duty position. Core tasks may be specified for a particular skill level or in general across the AFSC. Guidance for using core tasks can be found in the applicable CFETP narrative. Course Objective List (COL). A publication derived from initial/advanced skills Course Training Standard (CTS), identifying the tasks and knowledge requirements and respective standards provided to achieve a 3-skill level in this career field. Supervisors use the COL to assist in conducting graduate evaluations in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Course Training Standard (CTS). A standard developed for all courses not governed by an STS, including specialized training packages and computer-based training courses. Critical Tasks. Critical Tasks are tasks that require specific training and certification above and beyond other tasks. Tasks may be defined as critical either through AFI, Technical Orders, higher headquarters, or at any level in the unit. Cross-Utilization Training. Training on non-duty AFSC specific tasks.

Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A, B, U, X, or Z for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit from the current month or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members assigned to an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should sign out from the losing base after the 15day of the month in order to receive OFDA credit for that month. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within three months of the departure month. 2.5.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of aviation service for career enlisted aviators. Note: If required, members may accumulate badge-creditable OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18th or 20th year of aviation service. See AFI 11-402. 2.5.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or ground-based radar duty (FSC B), or returning to such duty from a disqualified or inactive status, other than FSC S, receive OFDA credit from the date of assignment of an active FSC. If such individuals do not fly within three months of that date, the HARM office will retroactively change the active FSC to FSC S, effective the day following the date of initial assignment of the active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit which began accruing with assignment of the original active FSC and terminate entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying or ground-based radar duty begins, effective two months before the date of the first flight. OFDA credit resumes from that date. Example: Captain Miller is assigned FSC A on 19 December but first flies on 17 April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to FSC S, effective 20 December. Captain Miller accumulated three months OFDA credit for January, February, and March. (Do not credit December because Capt Miller was assigned an active FSC for less than 15 days during that month.) The FSC S action deducts the three months credited and stops further accumulation. On 17 April, change the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17 February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit. Do not award OFDA credit for February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit for March and April. Credit continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform for a period greater than three months. 2.5.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated) and 20 years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month following the month in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to S effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in which flying duties were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to A again effective the date of the member‚Äòs next OFDA-creditable flight. Do not award retroactive credit. Example: Lt Rochon flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The HARM office assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and August. The HARM office changes the FSC back to A on 18 November. There is no OFDA credit for November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15 days during that month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October. 2.5.3.6.

For this reason civil engineers must always be aware of the latest tactics tech-niques and procedures (TTPs) used to protect our forces particularly in hos-tile environments. Engineers implement physical security measures to protect personnel and critical assets needed to achieve military objectives. To assist in these efforts this handbook is intended to be a reference for constructing and employing expedient fighting positions obstacles shelters and revet-ments. It focuses primarily upon measures engineers can employ to protect airbases and mitigate the effects of direct- and indirect-fired weapons. This handbook should be used in conjunction with AFH 10-222 Volume 3 Civil Engineer Guide to Expeditionary Force Protection as well as other 10-222 series AF Handbooks and 10-219 series AF Pamphlets. Although many of the TTPs described are designed to protect critical resources through hardening and the use of obstacles commanders must not lose sight of the fact that standoff provides the best chance of success in protecting the force. In addi-tion to the information contained in the aforementioned publications civil engineers should be familiar with the security engineering series of Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and the latest guidance provided by those organiza-tions constantly testing materials and designs to provide better protection for our military forces. These include organizations such as the Air Force Re-search Laboratory (AFRL) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Protective Design Center (PDC). This handbook does not address TTPs de-signed to defeat the vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) threat. The Air Force Battlelab through extensive testing developed an ex-cellent handbook for this purpose. AFH 10-2401 Vehicle Bomb Mitigation Guide (FOUO) focuses on the threat of VBIED attacks and describes the latest TTPs that can be employed to defeat this tactic. This handbook does not contain information for designing collective protection shelters. This informa-tion can be found in AFMAN 10-2502 series publications and USACE Engi-neering Technical Letters (ETLs) 1110-3-490 and 1110-3-498. USACE ETLs can be downloaded from httpwww.usace.army.mil.',\n",

Weather Career Field Technical Training Opportunities  6.1. The Need for Training.  Air Force civilian employees are hired as fully qualified based on Office of Personnel Management (OPM) qualification standards.  Therefore training requirements and skill level progression are different from the enlisted or officer programs.  However there is still a need for position specific on-the-job training and certification programs.  Position qualification is accomplished with a combination of local training checklists the officer or enlisted CFETP Tactics Techniques and Procedures andor Qualification Training Packages.  Once position qualified civilians require no further formal or skill level progression training.  However they are strongly encouraged to continue to learn and master all aspects of the Weather Career Field.  This Chapter highlights available formal courses and other technical training opportunities.  6.2. Weather Career Field Formal Courses.  This section identifies specific training courses',\n",
